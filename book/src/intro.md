Hi there!

**Logos** is a fast and easy to use [lexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis)
generator written in Rust. While Rust has excellent documentation tools (and you can access
the [API docs for Logos at docs.rs](https://docs.rs/logos/)), it's not the easiest thing to
document custom syntax used by procedural macros, of which Logos has a bit. This Handbook
seeks to remedy this!
